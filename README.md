# Magento Twitter Bootstrap SASS Theme

## Demo theme with Bootstrap and SASS

### Please Note
+ This theme is currently used at http://shop.clpress.com
+ You may modify it to your branding and theme assuming you know SASS and basic Magento theming.
+ CLPress.com currently makes use of the account screens, category pages, item pages, and checkout.  The category and home pages of http://shop.clpress.com are typically not seen since our main Drupal site at http://www.clpress.com tightly integrates with our Magento store at http://shop.clpress.com.  This may affect how you use this theme and you'll almost certainly require further modifications.
+ For more template modes grab the layout and template files from Magento's base theme.
+ The theme was originally started with Modern and there are some remaining pieces from it.
